# Project Finitte

## Project Description
My game consists of a boss battle inspired in Undertale. The gameplay is an infinite scroll down, where the attack of the boss rains on the player. To win, the goal of the player is to survive the enemy's attacks by avoiding the attack with the movement keys and collect counter-attack tokens, which will also be raining down with less frequency, to defeat the boss.
