# Project Finitte

## Project Description
My game consists of a boss battle inspired in Undertale. The gameplay is a vertical infinite scrol, where the attack of the boss rains on the player. To win, the goal of the player is to survive the enemy's attack by avoiding it with the movement keys and collect counter-attack tokens, which will also be raining down with less frequency, to chip away at the life bar and defeat the boss.

## Project Planning
### Day 1
Create the html structure and make the player move around the board.
- Create base structure of the game with placeholders
- Create a div with the id #player
- Create a js file with the player class
- Write the code for the movement of the player
- Create a js file to get the events of keypress/keyup.....
- Create a js file for the boss


### Day 2
Create the boss attack, the counter-attack and the movement mechanics. And create the starting screen that will run the gameplay.
- Create a js file with the attack class
- Create a js file with the counter-attack class
- Write the code for both elements' movement and interaction with the player
- Create the collision mechanic for both
- Create the game start screen
- Create a functional button to start the game


### Day 3
Create the life bars of the boss and the player and link them to the interations between the player and the element. And create the winning/losing screen that will stop the game from running.
- Create a life bar for each
- Write the code for the decreasing life mechanic upon collision with either the boss attack or the counter-attack tokens
- Create the losing or winning screen
- Create the button to reset the game
- Create the button to exit to the starting screen
